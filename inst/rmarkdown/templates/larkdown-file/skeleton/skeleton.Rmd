## Larkdown features

A Larkdown document is just a text document set up to be parsed into messages. It is not necessarily Markdown, but I think it makes the most sense to treat it as such. So a Larkdown document is just a Markdown document that can be parsed into a list of (user, text) tuples. The main use case at the moment is to pass messages to the Langchain python API, which means the first message's user must be "system", followed by alternating messages from "human" and "ai". That's not a strict requirement of Larkdown, however. 

Key things to note:

- Everything before the first line starting with `>` is ignored

```{r}
# library(larkdown)

register_endpoint("http://localhost:8000/larkdown-chat")
ld_stream_current()
```


>system 

You are a helpful assistant.

>human

What are some good programming languages for statistical computing?
